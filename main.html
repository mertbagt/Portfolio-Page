          </header>
          <p>In my former career I supported several tech and programming oriented teams administratively.  While I'm comfortable working with tech oriented co-workers, I had only dabbled in coding on the side; Now that I'm looking to switch careers, I'm excited to gain a more professional, solid foundation in coding practical applications to make peoples' lives easier.</p>
          <p>Outside of work, a couple interests are:</p>
          <ol> <!-- 1 or 2 sentences of interests outside of web development -->
            <li>I enjoy walking along the <a href="https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/virginia/sugarland-run-trail" target="_blank">local park trails</a>.  Having spent most of my career behind an office desk, it's good to get out, get some exercise and clear your head from time to time.</li>
            <li>I dabble a little bit with cooking, when I have time to spare.  Mostly light breakfast things, but it's fun to try <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMsXKCr9kL4" target="_blank">an unfamiliar dessert</a> once in awhile to mix things up.</li>
          </ol>
